 HPCHub benchmarks set.

Purpose: arrange set of different general and task-oriented tests to be able to compare
performance of different cloud HPC solutions/configurations.

Idea: separate platform-specific setups from task/test-specific code. Thus we have two 
directories: platforms and tests.

platforms contain one include .sh file for platform, which set environment variables, needed 
to install, compile and run tests on target platform.

tests contain one folder per test, which is expected to have at least two files:

install.sh and run.sh - these files are to be run on target platform from corresponding 
directory with HPCHUB_PLATFORM environment variable, containing path to required platform.sh 
file.

These files are expected to set HPCHUB_TEST_STATE environment variable into "install" or "run"
state respectively before sourcing platform file.

As for now (may be changed!) run.sh is expected to wait for filename in HPCHUB_REPORT for 
filename for a file to log the results (see corresponding run.sh in gromacs test).

doc directory contains documents, related to current discussion state of the project and all 
other required documents.
