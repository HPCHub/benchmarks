Identified residue LYS1 as a starting terminus.
Identified residue LEU129 as a ending terminus.
Start terminus LYS-1: NH3+
End terminus LEU-129: COO-
Checking for duplicate atoms....
Generating any missing hydrogen atoms and/or adding termini.
Now there are 129 residues with 1960 atoms
Processing chain 2 (78 atoms, 78 residues)
Problem with chain definition, or missing terminal residues.
This chain does not appear to contain a recognized chain molecule.
If this is incorrect, you can edit residuetypes.dat to modify the behavior.
Checking for duplicate atoms....

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.
