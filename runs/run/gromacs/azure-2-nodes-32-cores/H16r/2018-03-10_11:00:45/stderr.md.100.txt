Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -deffnm 1AKI-md_0_1.100


Number of logical cores detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!

Running on 2 nodes with total 32 cores, 32 logical cores
  Cores per node:           16
  Logical cores per node:   16
Hardware detected on host HPCHUB-CENTOS-H-1 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: GenuineIntel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

Reading file 1AKI-md_0_1.100.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 20, rlist from 1 to 1.03

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 24 particle-particle and 8 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 32 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
